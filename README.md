## Abstract
Robotics in general has revolved around the idea of replacing human
in order to improve overall life style of mankind or do chores more
efficiently.
Chunks of robotics are readily implemented at graduate level as a
solution to modern world problems.We aim to achieve one such
model where the Robotic Arm built will be capable of doing tasks
having direct impact on industries such as, explosives, hazardous
labs etc . The Arm built will be remotely operated one using latest
tech stack making it up to date model. Most of the backend
implemented will be Cloud based so can be upgraded with time. The basic features this model is expected to achieve are low cost, efficient upgradable and can be realized at any level some key
aspects to be kept in mind while deploying it also include
Flexibility, precision and wide area of application.
